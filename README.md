### üî¨ Smart Frame Finder (SFF)
Finding the right calibration frames (darks, flats, bias) for your light frames can be tedious. The Smart Frame Finder automates this process with a powerful, configurable search engine.
- **Context-Aware Search:** Start a search directly from a `LIGHT` frame to find matching calibration files. The system knows which parameters are relevant for each calibration type (e.g., `EXPTIME` for darks, `FILTER` for flats).
- **Flexible Rules Engine:** Activate and deactivate search criteria on the fly. You can match by `CCD-TEMP`, `BINNING`, `INSTRUME`, and many other FITS headers.
- **Tolerance Sliders:** Don't need an exact match? Use intuitive sliders to define acceptable tolerances for parameters like temperature (`¬±2¬∞`), date (`¬±30 days`), or exposure (`¬±10%`).
- **Dedicated Interface:** The SFF operates in a dedicated modal window, allowing you to build complex queries, view results, and download a `.zip` archive of the selected frames without leaving the main page.

### Duplicate Management
- **Content-Based Duplicate Detection:** Files are identified as duplicates based on their content hash (`xxhash`), regardless of their name or location. If two files have the same hash, they are considered duplicates.
- **Smart Duplicate Badge:** The main file table displays an intelligent badge in the format `Visible / Total` for files that have duplicates.
  - `5 / 5` (Yellow): Indicates 5 duplicates exist, and all are currently visible.
  - `1 / 5` (Gray): Indicates that this is the only visible file out of 5 duplicates. The other 4 have been hidden by the user.
- **Interactive Management Modal:** Clicking the badge opens a detailed modal window where users can:
  - View all duplicate files in a comprehensive table.
  - Designate a "reference" file that cannot be hidden.
  - Select and hide redundant duplicates to declutter the main view.
  - View and restore previously hidden files.
- **Sort by Duplicates:** The main table can be sorted by the number of visible duplicates, making it easy to find and manage files with the most copies.


### Resilient Indexing & Soft-Delete

The indexing engine is designed to be both efficient and resilient, making it suitable for managing large and dynamic data archives.

- **Fast Rescans:** The indexer uses a combination of file modification time (`mtime`) and size to quickly skip files that have not changed since the last scan. This makes subsequent indexing runs extremely fast.
- **Content-Based Identification:** Files are uniquely identified by their `xxhash`, a high-speed hashing algorithm.
- **Soft-Delete Recovery:** When a file is removed from the filesystem, it is not immediately deleted from the database. Instead, it is marked as "deleted" for a configurable retention period (default: 30 days). This provides a safety net against accidental deletions or temporary filesystem unavailability. If the file reappears within the retention period, it is instantly restored without need of full reindexing and hash calculation.

## üìã Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## ‚ö° Quick Start

> **Note:** This project uses a `build.sh` script to simplify the Docker build process. This script is compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows (using Git Bash or WSL).

1. Clone the repository and its submodules:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/michelegz/astro-web-indexer.git
cd astro-web-indexer
```
> **Note:** This project uses a Git submodule for the XISF library. If you have already cloned the repository without this flag, run `git submodule update --init` inside the project directory to download the necessary files.

2. Copy the example environment file and adjust as needed:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Prepare your FITS/XISF data directory.

   By default, the application looks for images inside a `./data/fits` directory. If you want to use this default, create it now:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p data/fits
   ```
   **Alternatively**, if you already have an image folder, you can edit the `.env` file and set `FITS_DATA_PATH` to your custom path (e.g., `FITS_DATA_PATH=/path/to/my/images`).

4. Build and start the application using the provided script:
```bash
./build.sh build
```
This command handles the entire build process, including automatically embedding the application version from Git.

5. Access the application at http://localhost:2080

### Managing the Application

The `build.sh` script provides several commands to manage the application's lifecycle:
- `./build.sh build`: Builds (or rebuilds) the Docker images and starts the services.
- `./build.sh build --no-cache`: Forces a complete rebuild of the images without using Docker's cache. This is useful when you have issues with outdated dependencies.
- `./build.sh start`: Starts the containers without rebuilding.
- `./build.sh stop`: Stops the containers.
- `./build.sh logs`: Follows the logs from all running containers.
- `./build.sh clean`: Stops the containers and removes any temporary files generated during the build.
- `./build.sh save`: Exports the versioned Docker images to a `.tar` archive for manual transfer.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All configuration is handled via environment variables, typically set in a `.env` file.

### Core Application

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `NGINX_PORT` | The port to expose the web interface on the host machine. | `2080` |
| `HEADER_TITLE` | The main title displayed in the application header. | `Astro Web Indexer` |
| `FITS_DATA_PATH` | The **host path** to the directory containing your FITS files. This directory will be mounted into the containers. | `./data/fits` |

### Indexing Service

These variables control the behavior of the Python indexing and watching scripts.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `RETENTION_DAYS` | The number of days to keep a record of a deleted file in the database before it is permanently purged. Set to `0` to disable purging. | `30` |
| `DEBUG` | Enables verbose debug logging for the indexing scripts. Set to `true` or `false`. | `false` |
| `THUMB_SIZE` | The size (width and height) in pixels for generated thumbnails. | `300` |

### Database Connection

These variables are shared across all services to connect to the MariaDB container. **Ensure they are consistent everywhere.**

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DB_HOST` | The hostname of the database service. Should match the service name in `docker-compose.yml`. | `mariadb` |
| `DB_NAME` | The name of the database to be created and used. | `awi_db` |
| `DB_USER` | The username for the database. | `awi_user` |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | The password for the database user. | `awi_password` |
| `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` | The root password for the MariaDB server. **It is highly recommended to change this.** | `rootpassword` |

### üé® Custom Logo

You can replace the default logo with your own by mapping a local SVG file. 

1.  Open the `docker-compose.yml` file.
2.  Locate the `php` service.
3.  Uncomment the volume mapping for the custom logo and replace `./path/to/your/logo.svg` with the actual path to your file.

```yaml
services:
  php:
    # ... other settings
    volumes:
      - ${FITS_DATA_PATH:-./data/fits}:/var/fits:ro
      # To use a custom logo, uncomment the following line and
      # replace ./path/to/your/logo.svg with the actual path to your logo file.
      - ./path/to/your/logo.svg:/var/www/html/assets/logo/custom_logo.svg:ro
```
The application will automatically use your logo. If this volume is not mapped, it will fall back to the default logo.


## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage & Scripts

The application's backend logic is handled by two main Python scripts located in `docker/python/`.

### `watch_fs.py` (The Watcher)
This script runs continuously in the background inside the `python` container. Its only job is to monitor the data directory (`FITS_DATA_PATH`) for file changes (creations, modifications, deletions). When a change is detected, it waits for a brief cooldown period and then automatically calls `reindex.py` to update the database. You generally do not need to interact with this script directly.

### `reindex.py` (The Indexer)
This is the core script that performs the heavy lifting: it scans the data directory, extracts metadata from FITS/XISF files, generates thumbnails, and updates the database records.

While the watcher runs this script automatically, you may need to run it manually for specific tasks, such as forcing a full re-index of all files. To do this, you can use `docker exec`:

**Example: Forcing a full re-index**
This command is useful if you change the thumbnail generation logic, suspect data corruption, or simply want to ensure everything is perfectly synchronized.

```bash
docker exec -it python-awi python /opt/scripts/reindex.py /var/fits --force
```

**Key Manual Options:**
- `--force`: Forces the script to re-process every file, even if its modification time and size haven't changed.
- `--skip-cleanup`: Prevents the script from marking files as deleted if they are no longer found on disk. This is useful if your data disk is temporarily disconnected.
- `--thumb-size <size>`: Overrides the `THUMB_SIZE` environment variable for a single run, allowing you to test different thumbnail sizes without restarting the container. For example: `--thumb-size 250`.

### Database Migrations
This project uses **Phinx** to manage database schema changes. Migrations are applied automatically when the application starts, ensuring the database is always up-to-date. Developers wishing to contribute schema changes should familiarize themselves with the Phinx workflow.

### Versioning

This project's version is automatically determined from Git tags. The `build.sh` script reads the latest Git tag (or commit hash) and passes it to Docker during the build process. This version is then displayed in the application's footer.

To release a new version, simply create and push a new tag before running the build script:

```bash
# Example for version 1.0.0
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
The next time you run `./build.sh build`, the new version number will be embedded in the application. If no tags are present, a development version based on the commit hash will be used.
